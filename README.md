# End-to-End Predictive Analytics Project Example

This dataset contains information about bank customers and their churn status, which indicates whether they have exited the bank or not. It is suitable for exploring and analyzing factors influencing customer churn in banking institutions and for building predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Predict which customers are likely to churn (i.e., stop doing business with the bank).

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Define the Problem
- **Goals**: Reduce churn rate by identifying at-risk customers and implementing retention strategies.

### 2. Data Collection
The data has been pulled from a [Kaggle banking churn datastet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset?resource=download) and contains the following features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Surname**: Customer’s last name.
- **CreditScore**: Numerical value representing the customer's credit score.
- **Geography**: The customer’s location (e.g., France, Spain, Germany).
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: Account balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of bank products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Binary flag indicating whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **IsActiveMember**: Binary flag indicating whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Customer’s estimated salary.
- **Exited**: Binary flag indicating whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

### 3. Data Preparation
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze distributions, correlations, and visualize data to understand patterns and relationships.
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
- **Transformation**: Normalize/standardize data, encode categorical variables, and create new features.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- 

### 5. Model Selection and Training
- **Data Splitting**: Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose several algorithms to test (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Training**: Train models on the training dataset and validate using cross-validation techniques.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Model Tuning**: Fine-tune hyperparameters using grid search or random search methods to improve performance.
- **Final Model Selection**: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### 7. Deployment
- **Integration**: Integrate the predictive model into the company’s CRM or a custom-built application.
- **Automation**: Set up automated pipelines to collect new data, retrain the model periodically, and update predictions.

### 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance on new data and track key metrics.
- **Retraining**: Periodically retrain the model to ensure it remains accurate as new data comes in.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for significant drops in model performance.

### 9. Actionable Insights
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on their churn probability.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Develop and implement retention strategies such as personalized marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, or special offers for high-risk customers.

### 10. Reporting and Feedback
- **Dashboard Creation**: Create dashboards to visualize churn predictions and track the effectiveness of retention strategies.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Regularly report findings and model performance to stakeholders and gather feedback for continuous improvement.
